# Orb Engine

A game engine project where most of my focus will be recreating game engine features, mainly rendering. 
The files in this respository is just all the code/features I've added to the engine and does NOT include 
any assets nor Visual Studio 2019 specific folders/files.Those will be added once there is much more to 
show in a scene. 

This is a passion project I am continuing to work on and will continue to do so as I learn more about game engines. 
A lot of it is inspired through online resources and from having worked with Unity.
